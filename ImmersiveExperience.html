    <p><i>There are two types of immersive experiences, one being when you are actually in a physical environment and the other where you are shown around a real or imagined environment via desktop, tablet, mobile or via VR ( Virtual Reality) headset.</i><p>
    <h3><center>Immersive Reality</center></h3>
    <p>Immersive virtual reality is a hypothetical future technology that exists today as virtual reality art projects, for the most part. It consists of immersion in an artificial environment where the user feels just as immersed as they usually feel in consensus reality. 
    Direct interaction of the nervous system
    The most considered method would be to induce the sensations that made up the virtual reality in the nervous system directly. In functionalism/conventional biology we interact with consensus reality through the nervous system. Thus we receive all input from all the senses as nerve impulses. It gives your neurons a feeling of heightened sensation. It would involve the user receiving inputs as artificially stimulated nerve impulses, the system would receive the CNS outputs (natural nerve impulses) and process them allowing the user to interact with the virtual reality. Natural impulses between the body and central nervous system would need to be prevented. This could be done by blocking out natural impulses using nanorobots which attach themselves to the brain wiring, whilst receiving the digital impulses of which describe the virtual world, which could then be sent into the wiring of the brain. A feedback system between the user and the computer which stores the information would also be needed. Considering how much information would be required for such a system, it is likely that it would be based on hypothetical forms of computer technology.</p>
    
    <h3><center>Perception</center></h3>
    <p>To create a sense of full immersion, the 5 senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) must perceive the digital environment to be physically real. Immersive technology can perceptually fool the senses through: </p>
    <p>Panoramic 3D displays (visual)</p>
    <p>Surround sound acoustics (auditory)</p>
    <p>Haptics and force feedback (tactile)</p>
    <p>Smell replication (olfactory)</p>
    <p>Taste replication (gustation)</p>
