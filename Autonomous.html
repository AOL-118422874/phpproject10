    <p><i>The emergence of autonomous things over the last few years, I believe, has been an exciting development within technology that is only going to become more innovative and more and more exciting as time goes on. Driven by the likes of big data, AI and cloud technologies, I have no doubt that – as these technologies advance – autonomous things are only going to continue to advance at a break neck speed.</i></p>
      <p>The emergence of autonomous things marks a key landmark in technological progress. Early examples include autonomous drones and self-driving vehicles. Expect to see more autonomous things as these kinds of technologies develop further.
        Autonomous things are fundamentally important because they represent the first real untethering of machines from explicit human guidance. Humans are used to programming things, but are not used to them acting in autonomous ways. Self-driving vehicles are still making their way onto the roads. While widespread adoption of autonomous things has yet to occur, there are indications that it is coming soon.</p>
    
    <p>Autonomous vehicles are constantly collecting data from their environment; such as the road conditions, potential hazards, pedestrians, surrounding vehicles and even storing the routes and roads themselves. In order for these vehicles to become safer they rely on a vast amounts of software and the collection of vast amounts of data to train the artificial intelligence to ensure the safety of their passengers without humans having to intervene. I have read a stat that says these vehicles exchange around 15,000 pieces of data within a tenth of a second, this is a figure that could rise to 200,000 pieces of data by 2020. That’s pretty quick, if you ask me.
The question remains though: how do architects fit in to all of this?
Well, we’re going to need architects to keep improving systems used to collect and store all of the data collected and the AI technology behind these vehicles. Only by taking full advantage of cloud technologies and continuing to search for improvements can the rate of growth can continue at an exponential rate. Furthermore, big data is key for developing driverless transport that is safer so our journeys’ can be transformed and engineers must be able to develop AI algorithms that will allow the vehicles to drive themselves.
The future of autonomous things relies heavily on the continued research and development behind big data, AI and cloud technologies. I can imagine it’s an exciting time to be an architect working in this world which is only going to explode in popularity as time goes by.</p>
